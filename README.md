There's not much I have to say about this thing. You probably don't give a fuck about it if you're just some stranger. If you know me in real life, then you probably have something to do with this.

<h2>Found a bug?</h2>

- If you're someone I know over the internet/some stranger, open a issue/contact me on Discord (Anmol#4838).

- If you're someone I know IRL, DM me on WhatsApp/SnapChat/Instagram/whatever the fuck you want to except reddit, I don't check that. I know ur lazy u won't open a issue.
